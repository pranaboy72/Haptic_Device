## Drain Pipe Cleaning Robot

We made a robot that can clean inside drain pipe by moving through it

With Arduino Uno & Dynamixel XH430V350R (https://www.robotis.com/shop/item.php?it_id=902-0129-000)
we made a controller that can control front two links intuitively & minutely.   
   
We added haptic function which helps the controller to share senses with the robot.   
   
There were some limits imitating haptic function with arduino. 
But we implemented haptic functionality by only sharing controller's sense to the robot.

They are for checking & updating dynamixel's id and baudrate.   
"debug" is for debugging the current velocity, position, etc of the dynamixel.
