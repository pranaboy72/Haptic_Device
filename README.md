With Arduino Uno & Dynamixel XH430V350R (https://www.robotis.com/shop/item.php?it_id=902-0129-000)
we made a controller that can control front two links intuitively & minutely.   
   
We added haptic function which helps the controller to share senses with the robot.   
   
There were some limits imitating haptic function with arduino. 
But we implemented haptic functionality by only sharing controller's sense to the robot. 
   
### link_robcon
With using motor_haptic_1 code, we linked controller and robot.   
We got the medium angle of the controller by forward kinematics.   
We substituted the angles of controller to the motor in the robot, and achieved same movement with each other.   
   
In the code,   
a,b : Each length of controller links   
theta2, theta5 : Upper & Lower motor's position of the controller   
theta3 : Angle between two links of controller's upper part   

### Debug Angle
It is used for debugging if the arduino calculates precise values of an angle.

### Other files
They are for checking & updating dynamixel's id and baudrate.   
"debug" is for debugging the current velocity, position, etc of the dynamixel.   

## USB Connect
```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
```

## How to Debug
Don't know the actual reason, but I couldn't debug the values on the serial monitor while activating the controller at the same time.   
Therefore you need additional arduino (I used Arduino Mega).      
   
   
1. Connect 7,8 pin of the UNO to TX, RX pin of MEGA
2. Connect GND pin with each other
3. Connect serial port each to the computer
4. Type these on the terminal to access USB connect
```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM1
```
5. Set "board" in the tool to "UNO" and "port" to "ACM0(the port you connected to UNO)"
6. Upload the code you want to use (e.g link robcon or debug angle)
7. Now change the "board" and "port" to the other one
8. Activate your Arduino and open the serial monitor (Don't forget to adjust baudrate)
